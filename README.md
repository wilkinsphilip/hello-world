# hello-world
Sales guy learning how to think systematically.

Working on a couple side projects from my day gig and my co-founder had me sign up!
With that, here I am trying to learn how tech really happens so that my sales rambling can become concise.

Not sure if I'm cut out for this but I'm going to give it a whirl!
